                <p>Siri understood my intent, pulled the local weather data via an API and answered me in less than two seconds: “There’s no rain in the forecast for today.”</p>
                <p>When I woke up this morning, I asked my assistant a simple question: “Siri, is it going to rain today?” <br>
    Siri understood my intent, pulled the local weather data via an API and answered me in less than two seconds: “There’s no rain in the forecast for today.” <br>
    In the not-too-distant past, this kind of human-computer interaction would have blown away technologists and delighted consumers — but in 2016, it’s nothing special. Conversations with Siri are commonplace, just like they are with Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. <br>
    Machine learning (ML) and narrow forms of artificial intelligence (AI) have officially reached the mainstream. The explosion of innovation we’re seeing in AI/ML stems from a series of rapid technological advances over the last few decades: widespread internet connectivity and proliferation of online data, faster/cheaper computers (per Moore’s Law), variable-cost cloud computing, R&D investments from large technology companies and a vibrant open-source software community.</p>
                <p>We haven’t yet built HAL 9000, but we’re getting closer.</p>
